## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add svrn https://svrn-global.github.io/helm-charts

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
svrn` to see the charts.

## Deployment and configuration

For deployment and configuration details, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.svrn.global/en/stable/getting-started/quick-start/).
